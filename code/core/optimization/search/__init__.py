"""
🎯 Optimization Search Module

RL-based and LLM-guided optimization discovery for compound performance techniques.

Components:
- MCTSOptimizer: Monte Carlo Tree Search for compound optimization discovery
- LLMOracle: LLM-guided optimization suggestions with learned context
- UnifiedOptimizer: Combines MCTS + LLM + heuristics

Usage:
    from core.optimization.search import search_optimal_config
    
    result = search_optimal_config(
        model_config={"parameters_billions": 70, ...},
        hardware_config={"num_gpus": 8, "gpu_arch": "hopper", ...},
        optimization_goal="throughput",
        budget=100
    )
